# Interpolation problem in Goerlitz

This repo has a Jupyter notebook focusing on the interpolation of rain gauge data along a river and obtaining head data to implement boundary conditions type 2 in a numerical model of groundwater for water supply in the city of Goerlitz, Saxony, Germany. This repository was developed very quickly to support Mendieta's *MSc* thesis, and therefore it is still not tested. <br>
